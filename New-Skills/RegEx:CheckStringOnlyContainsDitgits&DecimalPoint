if(mystring.matches("^[0-9]*\\.?[0-9]*$")) {
    // Do something
}
else {
    // Do something else
}

/**
This RegEx states:

The ^ means the string must start with this.
Followed by none or more digits (The * does this).
Optionally have a single decimal (The ? does this).
Follow by none or more digits (The * does this).
And the $ means it must end with this.
Note that bullet point #2 is to catch someone entering ".02" for example.

If that is not valid make the RegEx: "^[0-9]+\\.?[0-9]*$"
