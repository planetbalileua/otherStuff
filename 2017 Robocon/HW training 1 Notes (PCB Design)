-dont add ROM when drawing PCB
-press TAB to change the wire width
 signal 10 mil
 power 30 mil
-use num lock * for via
-shift-s : only display one side layer
    press * again to change the side
-define board shape : there is a mystery button go 
-design board shape to define board shape
-board shape: create primitive from board shape
-draw polygon->right click - rebuild all
-tools:design rule check
-design: change rules
-components list: smart PDF
-LM2479: step down 24V to 5V
  * need to know current limit, voltage output
  * You might need to calculate some of the value of resistor/inductor
 
-datasheet might have detail design procedure
